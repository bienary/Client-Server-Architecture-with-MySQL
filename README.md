#### **Understanding Client-Server Architecture**

- `Client-Server` refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

- **In their communication, each machine has its own role:**

> The machine sending requests is usually referred to as the "Client"

> The machine responding (serving) is called the "Server"
