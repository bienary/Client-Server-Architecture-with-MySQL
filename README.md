#### **Understanding Client-Server Architecture**

- `Client-Server` refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

- **In their communication, each machine has its own role:**

> The machine sending requests is usually referred to as the "Client"

> The machine responding (serving) is called the "Server"

> Our Web Server has a role of a `Client` that connects and reads/writes to/from a Database (DB) Server (MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server or any other), and the communication between them happens over a Local Network (it can also be Internet connection, but it is a common practice to place Web Server and DB Server close to each other in local network).

**2. On mysql-server instance: Install MySQL Server**

- SSH into the Server instance.

```
ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>
```
- Update and Upgrade system packages:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
- install `MySQL Server`
```
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```
